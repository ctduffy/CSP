**Lunch Tables Generator**

Team members: Leela Ghaemmaghami, Clara Duffy, Cooper Spinelli

This site serves the purpose of allowing teachers to sort students into lunch tables based on their gender and personality type as well as randomness.
The index page of the website provides two options: "edit lists" and "generate tables". 
Unless the teacher already has a group saved in the site, they will have to create a new group and fill in each student's attributes. 
Then, they can go to generate tables and send a request to the server with the specified group of kids and number of tables and chairs. 
The process of sorting may take a few minutes, so there is a loading page until the tables have been generated. 
When the tables are generated, they are displayed on a unique /tables page which has the options of manually editing or printing.
